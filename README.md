# Rx Java Study

I created this notes while reading the book [Reactive Programming With JavaRx](https://github.com/trinadhkoya/head-first-collection/blob/master/Reactive%20Programming%20with%20RxJava.pdf), 2017 edition. I filled the code with notes to a quick read of the content of the book. Feel free to take them, study them and run them.
